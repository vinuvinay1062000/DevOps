                   Kubernetes
     
  * It is the greek word for helmsman or caption of ship.
  * The logo of the k8s represents the steering of the ship.
  * kubernetes is also refered to as k8s, as there are 8 charaters between k and s .
  
 ---------------------------------------------------------- 
  1) what is k8's?
  
  its a container management tool or (container orchestration engine ).
  
  container orchestration tool means 
  
 * it was developed by google lab and later donated to CNCF.(cloud native computing foundation)
 *It is a open source and written in go programing language (golang) and its also call k8's.
 ------------------------------------------------
 
 2) what is container management tool?
  
 * container management tool manages containerized applications
  
  * container orchestration tool or engine automates deploying , scaling , and managing containerized application on a group of servers.
  
  example ; kubernetes , docker swarm , apache mesos marathon ,etc..
  
  * manges containerized application means ;
    deploying
    scheduling
    scaling
    load balancing.
    
  3) what are containerized applications ?
  
  example docker
   *  docker is a tool designed to make it easier to deploy and run applications by using containers.
   *  containers allow a developer to packages up an application with all of the parts needs such as libraries and other dependencies and ship it all out as one package.
   
   
   let's now see where does kubernetes comes into picture.  
   
   organizations have to use multiples containers to 
     * ensure avalibility 
     * load balancing
     * scale up and down based on user load.
     
   if we want to take care of all the process manually its very difficult ,
     
     deploying.
     scheduling 
     scaling
     load balancing
     batch execution.
     rollbacks
     monitoring.
     
     so , kubernetes will take care this process automaticly.
     
     * docker will create the container
     * kubernetes will manages the container.
     
     features of kubernetes 
  * Automatic bin packing .
  * Service discovery and load balancing.
  * Storage orchestration
  * self-healing.
  * Automated rollouts & rollbacks.
  * secret & configuration management.
  * Batch execution.
  * Horizontal scaling.
